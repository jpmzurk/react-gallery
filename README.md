# Project Name

Gallery of Life

## Description

Duration 2 Day Sprint

Problem solved with this was how to display a gallery of images, each with buttons to "like" and "delete", and find a manner to hide the description under a click event.  This app used functional and class components in React to render the gallery of images in succinct modern manner. 

This project also uses an PostreSQL database to solve the problem of where to store the file paths to photos, descriptions and most importantly the amount of likes.

Prerequisites

-Node.js
-PostGres

Installation

-Create a database called "react_gallery"
-The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary table and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. Postico is recommended to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
-Open Editor of choice and npm install
-Run npm run server
-Run npm run client

Usage

The user uploads a photo and a description. They may like the photo, or delete the photo. This sort of app is extremely familiar in 2020 and would be best used with others who could log in and share their photos and like yours! For now, this is a representation of what that looks like on a much smaller scale. 

Built With
